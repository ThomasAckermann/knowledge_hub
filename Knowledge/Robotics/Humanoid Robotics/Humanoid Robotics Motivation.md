## Professor's Motivation
- Understanding human versatility
- creating multi-purpose machines
- Engineering human-centered robot technologies. to empower humans
### Goals for humanoid robotics
- Companions and assistants for humans in daily life
- Helpers in man-made natural disasters in Japan after Fukushima
- Benchmark: win in the football world cup 2050
### Why is humanoid robotics interesting/required?
- World is made for humans - Robots need to be able to navigate this world
- Demographic change in china
- Humanoids are better understandable for humans
- Understanding human-like general-purpose physical intelligence
- Understanding human versatility and motion intelligence
- The next revolution is the fusion of robotics and AI

- Versatility: Humanoid robots
	- are versatile
	- can act and interact in made-for-human environments
	- can use made-for-human tools
	- human body is the best morphology we know so far
- Better prediction of robot actions
	- Motion behavior of robots with human-like morphology, i.e. humanoid robots, allows humans to better predict the robot actions. This promotes intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction
- Acceptance
	- human-like appearance may support acceptance and intuitive human-robot interaction but the uncanny valley reveals that human-likeness creates discomfort and rejection
- Humanoid robots are (best) experimental platforms "bodies" to study theories about natural intelligence
