## Goal
Additional surface information by including local neighboring points

Bassis for further algorithms

## Approach

- PCA-based approach
- Create the [[Covariance matrix]] $C$ of the $k$-point neighborhood for each point $p$
- Determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of C
	- Principal Component [[Analysis]] (PCA) -> Eigenvector to smallest eigenvalue corresponds to the normal
