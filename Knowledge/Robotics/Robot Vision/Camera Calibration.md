Camera calibration means determining the extrinsic and [[Intrinsic parameters]] of the camera. This requires at least 6 correspondences between non-coplanar world points and their projections onto the [[Image]] plane.
Often done with chess board.
One can the find the optimal solution using least squares method for such an overdetermined [[Linear]] system of equations.
