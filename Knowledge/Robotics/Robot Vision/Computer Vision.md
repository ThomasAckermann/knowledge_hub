## Problems in Computer Vision

- Low-level Vision
	- Noise reduction
	- Contrast enhancement
- Mid-level Vision
	- Segmentation
	- Line fitting
- High-level vision
	- Object recognition
	- [[Pose]] estimation

Top-down methods: model based
Bottom-up: data driven

We want to process some signals (images/[[Image]] sequences) and want to get semantic representations.
