Hue (H), Saturation(S) and Intensity(I)

**Components of HSI:**
1.  **Hue (H):**
- Represents the color type (e.g., red, blue, green).
- Defined as an angle in the range **[0°, 360°]** on the color wheel.
- 0° = Red, 120° = Green, 240° = Blue.

2. **Saturation (S):**
- Represents the purity or intensity of the color.
- A value between **0 and 1** (or 0% to 100%).
- **S = 0** means the color is grayscale (no chromaticity).
- **S = 1** means the color is fully saturated (pure color).

3. **Intensity (I):**
- Represents the brightness of the color.
- Computed as the average of the RGB components.
