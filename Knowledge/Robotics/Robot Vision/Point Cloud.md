A point cloud is a discrete set of 3D points with fixed coordinate system.
Two different types of representation
- Organized/Ordered Point cloud: 2D array format, Allocate memory for all possible positions, even empty ones
- Unorganized/unordered point cloud: vector format, point stored in a list without predefined structure/arrangement; only actual points are stored $->$ memory efficient but it is hard to find neighboring points
