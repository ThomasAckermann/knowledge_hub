The relationship between the [[Camera coordinate system]] and the [[World coordinate System]] is described by the extrinsic parameters: a rotation $R$ and a translation $T$ in space. $R$ and $T$ specify the transformation from the [[World coordinate System]] to the [[Camera coordinate system]] such that for a world point $x_w$ the camera coordinates $x_c$ are determined by:
$x_c = R x_w + T$
