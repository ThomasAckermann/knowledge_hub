Often used for post processing of binary images. There are two important operations:
- Dilation: Enlarges pixels into larger areas OR operator
- Erosion: removes isolated pixels and weakly connected pixel groups, AND operator

Effect of the operator depends on the [[Structural Element]]. Dilation and Erosion are often applied one after the other.
