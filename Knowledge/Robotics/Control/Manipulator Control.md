The manipulator [[Control]] is a block diagram of a manipulator [[Control System]]. The term manipulator [[Control]] does not only include classic position [[Control]], but also includes influences of the environment. Force and torque [[Control]] plays a special role in manipulator [[Control]].

The starting point is a [[Dynamic Model]]. During movements, gravitational, centrifugal, coriolis and frictional forces and torques act on the joints due to the inertia of the manipulator.
