Describes the [[End effector velocities]] for [[Joint]] angle velocities $\| \dot{\theta}\| = 1$. Use $J(\theta)$ to map the unit circle of [[Joint]] angle velocities to the space of [[End effector velocities]]. The result is the [[Manipulability]] ellipsoid. It Depends on the [[Joint]] angle configuration.

[[Analysis]]:
- Circle ("Large Ellipsoid")
	- [[End effector]] Movement is possible without restriction in any direction
- Degenerate cases (compressed ellipsoid: [[End effector]] movement is restricted in certain directions)
