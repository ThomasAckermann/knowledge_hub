The kinematic model of a [[Robot]] describes the relationship between the [[Joint]] space ([[Robot]] coordinates, [[Configuration Space]]) and the space of [[End effector]] poses in world coordinates ([[Task Space]], cartesian space)

Areas of application:
- Relationship between [[Joint]] angles and poses of the [[End effector]]
- [[Reachability]] [[Analysis]]
- Geometric relation between the body parts of the [[Robot]] (self-collision)
- Geometric relation to the environment ([[Collision Detection]])
