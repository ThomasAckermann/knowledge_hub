#Robotics #Mechanics 
Multiple queries for given [[Kinematic Chain]]

1. Step Preprocessing:
	- Approximation of the [[Configuration Space]] by a roadmap
	- Approximation of the work space by voxels
	- Mapping from voxels to roadmap (nodes, edges)
2. Query
	- Identify voxels with obstacle
	- Adjust the roadmap
	- Plan within the adjusted roadmap
