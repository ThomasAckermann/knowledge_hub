Difference Quotient is a numerical method to solve the [[Inverse Kinematics]] problem.
1. Actual movement according to $\dot{x}(t) = J(\theta) \dot{\theta}(t)$ 
2. Approximate movement in the interval $\delta t$ using the differnence quotient: $\Delta x = J(\theta)\Delta \theta$ 
Here the approximation of the change is done by transitioning from the differential quotient to the difference quotient. This way the problem is linearized.
