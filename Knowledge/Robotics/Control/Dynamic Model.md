## Definition
The dynamic model describes the relationship between the actuator and contact forces and moments acting on a [[Robot]] and accelerations and motions they produce
## Goal
- [[Analysis]] of the [[Knowledge/Physics/Kinematics/Dynamics]]
- Design and synthesis of mechancial structures
- Controller design and [[Control]] (_$\rightarrow$ Inverse [[Knowledge/Physics/Kinematics/Dynamics]])
- Modeling and simulation ($\rightarrow$ Forward [[Knowledge/Physics/Kinematics/Dynamics]])
