The moment of inertia of a rigid body in a rotation motion is comparable to the mass in a [[Linear]] motion. If a body is subjected to a torque, gyroscopic effects develop (Euler forces and centrifugal forces at all mass points).
The torques can be added up and described by [[Euler's equation of Motion]] for rigid bodies. 

## Basic Principle

Considering the center of mass of a single arm element:
- force = change of momentum $\rightarrow$ temporal derivation of the momentum
- torque = change of angular momentum $\rightarrow$ time derivative of the angular momentum + torque of gyroscopic effects ([[Euler's equation of Motion]])
Forces and torques acting on an arm element can be calculated from velocity and [[Joint]] angular velocity.
