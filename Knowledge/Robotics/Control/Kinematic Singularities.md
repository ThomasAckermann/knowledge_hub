#Kinematics #Robotics 

If a [[Robot]] is in a configuration, in which it is no longer able to move instantaneously in one or more directions, this is referred to as a kinematic singularity.
Configurations that lead to a kinematic singularity are called singular. It is possible to distinguish singular from non-singular configurations using the [[Jacobian Matrix]].
Kinematic singularity means that the [[Linear]] combination of Jacobian columns does not span the entire [[End effector]] velocity space. The [[Jacobian Matrix]] then has a rank smaller than the [[Workspace]] dimension.
