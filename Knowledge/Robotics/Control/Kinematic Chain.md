#Robotics #Kinematics 

A kinematic chain is formed by several bodies that a kinematically connected by joints

Each arm element corresponds to one rigid body. Each arm element is connected to the next on by a [[Joint]].  

For prismatic and rotational joints: Each [[Joint]] has only one degree of freedom. Kinematic parameters: [[Joint]] definition and Transformation between joints.

A transformation must be determined for each link: 
- 3 rotation parameters
- 3 translation parameters
-> 6 parameters per link of the kinematic chain
