#Robotics 
## Definition
Term Robot comes from the Czech Writer Karel Capek. He introduced the term „robota“ (west-Slavian: heavy work) in his play R.U.R (Rossum‘s Universal Robot). For Capek, a robot is (in contrast to humans) restlessly working.

In industrial context: A robot is a freely programmable, multifunctional manipulator with at least 3 independent axes, to move materials, parts, tools or devices along programmed, variable trajectories to fulfill different tasks.

Scientific context:
Robots are sensorimotor machines to extend human capacity to act. They consist of mechatronic components, sensors and computer-based [[Control]] functionalities. The number of complexity of a robot differs significantly from other machines due to the higher number of [[Degrees of Freedom]], as well as the variety and extent of its actions.

## Robotics Field of Application

- Industrial [[Robot]]
	- usually stationary
	- few [[Degrees of Freedom]]
	- easy programming
	- More effective than humans
- Service [[Robot]]
	- A [[Robot]] that works half or fully autonomous aiming to perform useful tasks to benefit humans and institution
- Personal [[Robot]]

## Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

1. A [[Robot]] may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
2. A [[Robot]] must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first Law
3. A [[Robot]] must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or second law
