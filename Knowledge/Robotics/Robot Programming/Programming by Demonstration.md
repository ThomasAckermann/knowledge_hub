#Robotics #RobotActions #MachineLearning 
- Observe Humans
- Interpret human demonstrations
- Map to [[Robot]] 

Main Goal
- Intuitive [[Robot Programming]] without expert [[Knowledge]]
- Learning of task models from human demonstrations

## Challenges

Whom to imitate?
When to imitate?
- The imitator has to segment and identify the beginning and end of a shown behavior
- The imitator has to decide if the observed behavior is appropriate in the current context.
What to imitate?
- How to determine what aspects of a demonstration are of interest? 
- Some observable properties are irrelevant and can be ignored
- For continuous [[Control]] tasks, this corresponds to determining the feature space for learning, as well as constraints and the cost function
How to imitate?
- Determine how the [[Robot]] will acutally perform the learned behaviour to maximize the metric found when solving the what to imitate problem
- The [[Robot]] has to learn how to imitate by mapping perception into a sequence of motion actions related to its own body
	- Correspondence problem
