## Trajectory
Generalization:
- Generalization of motions
Advantage:
- General representation of motions that allow encoding different kinds of signals or functions
Disadvantage:
- Complex skills cannot be reproduced

## Symbolic
Generalization:
- Organization of predefined motion elements
Advantage:
- Enables learning of hierarchical task descriptions
Disadvantage
- Needs a set of predefined controllers for reproduction
