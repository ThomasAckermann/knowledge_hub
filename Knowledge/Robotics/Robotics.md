Robotics is the science of engineering technical systems with intelligent behavior for real world usage, i.e., technical systems that generate motions as the basis of intelligence, perceive and evaluate situations, are able to predict and interpret consequences of actions and can continually learn from interactions with the real world, to broaden their cognitive horizon.
