[[Control]] theory is the theory of automatic, goal oriented influencing of dynamic, time-dependent processes at run time.
The fundamental situation in [[Control]] theory is that we want to design a system for automatic, targeted influencing a process with incomplete system [[Knowledge]], in particular in the presence of disturbances. The methods of [[Control]] theory are universally applicable, independent of the specific nature of the given system.
