In [[Control Theory]] the transfer function is defined by
	$G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Input}}$
Where $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the [[Laplace Transform]] of $u(t)$ and $y(t)$.
The transfer function is important for the controller design:
- [[Analysis]] of the system behavior with different input signals
- Determination of the controller parameters $\rightarrow$ Optimization of the parameters for the given system
