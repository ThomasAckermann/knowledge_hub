The [[Control]] loop is a block diagram of a [[Control System]].
- From physical laws, we can derived equations that describe the relationship between time-varying quantities of the system
- The time-varying quantities and their equations are represented by suitable symbols
- A block in the block diagram uniquely assigns each time response of the input variable to a time response of the output variable, thus acting as a [[Transfer Element]].
