A rigid body is a body that does not deform or change shape

Rigid body motion is characterized by two properties:
1. The distance between any two points remains invariant
	- The motion of the body is completly specified by the motion of any point in the body
	- All points of the body have the same velocity and same acceleration
2. The orientations are preserved
	- A right-handed coordinate system remains right handed
