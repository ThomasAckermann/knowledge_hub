The action is the defined by the space time integral of the Lagrange density: $S = \int \mathcal{L} \text{d}x^\mu$.
 The principle of least action says that nature always takes the path of least action. This can be computed using the variation. $\delta S = 0$. By solving this one arrives at the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]].
