Generelized coordinates can be in any coordinate system. They are the set of independent coordinates that completely describe the system state. There are often less than $3N$ coordinates required to describe a system because of contraints. There are the following constraints:
- [[Holonomic constraints]]
- [[Nonholonomic constraints]]
- [[Rheonomous constraints]]
- [[Scleronomic constraints]]
