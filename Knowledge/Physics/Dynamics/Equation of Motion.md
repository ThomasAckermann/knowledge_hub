Equations of motion are equations that describe the behaviour of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time. More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behavior of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables.

In Mechanics the general equation of motion has the following form: $\tau = M(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + g(q) + \epsilon (q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$
Here:
- $q$: [[Generalized coordinates]]
- $\tau$ vector of the generalized forces
- $M(q)$ Matrix of mass inertia (symmetric, positive-definite)
- $C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q}$ vector with centripetal and coriolis components
- $g(q)$ vector of gravitational components
- $\epsilon (q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$ non-[[Linear]] effects, e.g. friction
