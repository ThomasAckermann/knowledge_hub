## Goal
Machine learning on micro controllers. Here one only has a limited a amount of ressources.
The idea is to run compact models. Specialized frameworks are required for micro controllers. An example is TensorFlow Lite.

Difference TinyMl and traditional ML:
- TinyML are limited by their ressources
- TinyML models are much smaller
- Computation is done on the microcontroller
- It needs to be energy efficient
- Low-latency required

Training is done on a high performance computer. The model is then injected into microcontroller and run on it.
