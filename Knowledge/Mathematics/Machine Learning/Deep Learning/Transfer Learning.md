## Process
Training starts with a pre trained neural netwrok. 
Model selection: a pre trained model is selected for an exercise. The selection of the model depends on how similar the tasks are. 
Transfer learning: 
- the pre-trained model is used as a starting point for the new task.
- Feature selection: the features of pretrained models are used for a new model which is trained from ground up
