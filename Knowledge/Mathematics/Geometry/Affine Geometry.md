We use affine [[Geometry]] to describe spatial transformations. These transformations are concatenations of rotations and translations.
Spatial transformation can be represented mathematically in several ways:
- rotation matrices and tralsation vectors
- [[Homogeneous Matrices]]
- [[Quaternions]]
- dual [[Quaternions]]
