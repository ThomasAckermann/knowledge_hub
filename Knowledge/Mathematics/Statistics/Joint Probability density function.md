The joint [[Probability density function]] of two [[Random Variables]] $x$ and $y$ is given by the relation $P_{x,y} = \int \int p_{x,y}\text{d}x \text{d}y$ 

The marginal pdfs of two [[Random Variables]] $x$ and $y$ are 
$p_x(x) = \int p_{x,y} \text{d}y$
and likewise integrating over $x$ gives $p_y(y)$
