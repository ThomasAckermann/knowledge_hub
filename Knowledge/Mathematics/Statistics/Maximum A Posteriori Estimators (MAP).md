The maximum a posteriori (Map) vector estimator is $\hat{\theta} = \underset{\theta}{\arg \max}\ p(\theta \mid x)$.
This method uses the prior information to get a better guess. A good. prior can improve convergence. A narrow prior means we have a good idea where the true parameter is. The MAP exploits this and provides better estimates. A wide prior means we have a vague idea where the true parameter is. With this prior, the MAP estimate is not better. For MAP to outperform MLE we need an informative prior.
