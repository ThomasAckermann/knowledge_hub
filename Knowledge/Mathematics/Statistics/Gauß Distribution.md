The Gau√ü or also called normal distribution in one dimension is given by $p_x(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \text{e}^{- \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$.


In $N$ dimensions the multivariate normal distribution is given by:
$p(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{N/2}\det{\Sigma}} \exp{[- \frac{1}{2}(x- \mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu)]}$
Where $\Sigma$ is the [[Covariance matrix]].
