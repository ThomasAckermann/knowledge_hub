Informally, the probability density function (PDF) $p_x(x)$ of a continuous random variable $x$ is the limiting function of such histograms, as bin widths go to zero.
The probability that a realization of $x$ continuous is in the intverval $[a,b]$ is $P_x(a\leq x \leq b) = \int^b_a p_x(x)\text{d}x$.
