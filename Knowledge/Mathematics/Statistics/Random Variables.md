#Statistics 
A random variable $x$ informally describes an experiment that can be repeated under identical conditions. A realization of $x$ is the outcome of one experiment. The set of possible outcomes is the sample space $\mathcal{X}$. 

### Independent variables
If $x$ and $y$ are independent, then $E(x\cdot y) = E(x) \cdot E(y)$
