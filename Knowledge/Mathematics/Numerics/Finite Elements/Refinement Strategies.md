## Mesh Generation

Constructing a suitable mesh can be quite difficult. Usually one starts with a very coarse mesh and introduce and iterative algorithm to make this mesh finer, thereby keeping track of all the important data structures by suitably updating one from a previous step.

There are two cases: non-uniform and uniform refinement.
