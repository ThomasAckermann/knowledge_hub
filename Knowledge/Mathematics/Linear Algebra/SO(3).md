#LinearAlgebra 

$SO(3)$ contains all possible rotations around arbitrary axes in 3 dimensions. It is not commutatie. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose.

Problems with rotation matrices:
- Redundancy: nine values for one rotation matrix
- In [[Machine Learning]]: if the entries of a rotation are predicted independently, it is likely that the resulting matrix is not a valid rotation matrix
