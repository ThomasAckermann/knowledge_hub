Redundancy but with additional boundary conditions that guarantee orthogonality ($R * R^\top$). Axes of rotation and rotation sequence are implicitly included.

A homogeneous $4 \times 4$ matrix contains 12 non trivial variables. Normal [[SO(3)]] matrix with additional row and columnd. The additional column has the translation information and the bottom row has zeros and one one in the new column.
